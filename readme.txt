Embed any page of the internet on your wordpress blog without the theme
affecting how it looks and not iframing it

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to take any page from the internet and embed it in a
wordpress page.
Ideal for people who have a wordpress setup for their whole site as CMS but
they need landing pages that are out of the theme structure.

== Installation ==

Best is to install directly from WordPress. 
If manual installation is required, please make sure all of the plugin files are in a folder named "MVHispano-any-page-embed" (not two nested folders) in the plugin directory.
